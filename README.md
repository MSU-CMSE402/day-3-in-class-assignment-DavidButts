# In-class assignment for day 3

Instructions:  Read the two sets of questions on "evaluating plots" and "creating plots." 

Your group will be assigned a graphic to think about and talk about. Use the "evaluating plots" questions to critically analyze the plot you have been assigned, and figure out what its flaws are.  Then, use the "creating plots" questions to think about how to make a better version of it!  When you are done, make two lists: one of the flaws, and one of the ways to make it better.  Note that a member of your group will be chosen at random to tell the class about your group's thoughts, so be ready!
